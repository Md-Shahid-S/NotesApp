- **Chronological Organization**: Entries are organized by date and time for easy tracking of progress

- **Simple Interface**: Clean, intuitive UI designed for quick daily logging

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Built with Kotlin for Android
- Uses Room Database for local data persistence
- Implements MVVM architecture pattern
- Utilizes Jetpack Compose and View Binding for UI
- Built entirely using vibe coding methodology

### Dependencies
- AndroidX Core and Lifecycle components
- Room Database for data storage
- Material Design 3 components
- Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations

### Requirements
- Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher
- Targeting Android 14 (API level 34)

## Getting Started

### For Users
1. Install the application on your Android device
2. Open the app to view the entries list

4. Fill in the details for your daily activities
5. Save the entry to keep track of your progress
6. Review past entries by scrolling through the list

### For Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle files
4. Build and run the application

## Project Structure

- `app/src/main/java/com/shahid/premogear/`
  - `MainActivity.kt`: Initial activity (currently minimal)
  - `ExplorerActivity.kt`: Main activity for viewing and managing entries
  - `EntryAdapter.kt`: RecyclerView adapter for displaying entries
  - `data/`
    - `Entry.kt`: Data class representing a daily entry
    - `EntryDao.kt`: Data Access Object for Room Database operations
    - `AppDatabase.kt`: Room Database configuration

## Development Methodology

This application was built entirely using **vibe coding** - a development approach that emphasizes intuitive, flow-state programming where developers code based on creative inspiration and positive energy rather than rigid specifications. This methodology encourages innovation and creates a more enjoyable development experience while maintaining code quality.

## Current UI

This is the UI I'll make more better in future. It was just a first attempt at creating the interface for tracking daily activities. The current interface shows:

- A clean blue header with app title and refresh button
- Entry cards with date/time stamps
- Four tracking categories with emoji indicators:
  - üí™ Exercise Log
  - üß† Skill Development
  - üìö Extra Learning
  - ‚úçÔ∏è Daily Journal
- Floating action button (+) for adding new entries
- Simple delete functionality for managing entries

## Future Enhancements

- Data visualization for progress tracking
- Reminder notifications for daily entries
- Cloud synchronization for data backup
- Categories and tags for better organization
- Export functionality for entries
